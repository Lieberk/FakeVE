Multimodal Fake News Video Explanation: Dataset, Analysis and Evaluation

Multimodal fake news videos are difficult to interpret because they require comprehensive consideration of the correlation and consistency between multiple modes. Existing methods deal with fake news videos as a classification problem, but it's not clear why news videos are identified as fake. Without proper explanation, the end user may not understand the underlying meaning of the falsehood. Therefore, we propose a new problem - Fake news video Explanation (FNVE) - given a multimodal news post containing a video and title, our goal is to generate natural language explanations to reveal the falsity of the news video. To that end, we developed FakeVE, a new dataset of 2,672 fake news video posts that can definitively explain four real-life fake news video aspects. In order to understand the characteristics of fake news video explanation, we conducted an exploratory analysis of FakeVE from different perspectives.

## Aspect Inclusion:

- **Contextual Dishonesty (CD)**: News titles are semantic or out of context to video or audio content.
- **Splice Tampering (ST)**: Pering a news video is deliberately selected or randomly spliced, resulting in a lack of logical coherence or data unrelated to the title or audio theme.
- **Synthetic Voiceover (SV)**: News audio is synthetic speech generated by clips whose content is inconsistent with the subject matter of the video picture or the title.
- **Contrived Absurdity (CA)**: News video, audio, and titles are consistent in their multimodal content, but the overall message defies basic common sense or logic.
